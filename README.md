LifeSaver VR Application Demo to assist users with administering emergency aid in the event of physical injury.

Built on Meta Quest 2 using Unity Meta SDK.

The technical features I will be implementing are Teleportation, Raycast Selection, Wayfinding, Voice Recognition, and a Radial Menu in the hand.

I will be spending my creative efforts on making sure it is as easy as possible for any person to use this demo from the get-go.
